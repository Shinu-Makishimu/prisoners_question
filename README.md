# The Prison Game

This is just some code which checks the most successful strategy for solving this task: 

## Description

A jailer with a warped sense of humor suggests that a hundred prisoners play a game. According to the rules, a hundred boxes are hidden with a hundred notes with numbers. The task of the prisoners is to open no more than fifty boxes in turn and find their number. If everyone succeeds, they will be free. If even one fails, they will all be executed.

## The Solution:
A prisoner goes to the box with the number equal to his number. He opens the box, looks at the number in this box and goes to the corresponding box, and so on until his attempts are exhausted or he finds his number.
